According to the reading material, the author presents three ways to address the decline of Torreya. However, the professor in the listening argues that none of the ways are practical.

The first way mentioned by the author is to reestablish Torreya in the same location which has a specific wetter and cooler microclimate that is benificial to Torreya's growth.The professor in the listening, however, argues that it won't work because the weather has stronggly changed due to the global climate change.It has become more dryer, which is no longer suitble for Torreya.

The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location far from its original area. The professor in the listening, however, argues that it will lead to unexpected outcome. He mentioned an example that people used to migrate another specious, and this kind of plant spreads so rapidly that it kills the local specious there which are also endangered.

The last approach is to preserve Torreya in reaserch centers which has a closely monitored environment. The professor in the listening also argues that it's not practical. Since the reaserch centers cannot keep a large population to resist diseases, while in the wild a large amount won't suffer from the minor satisfatory.

According to the reading material, the author presents three ways to address the decline of Torreya. However, the professor in the listening argues that none of the ways is practical.
The first way mentioned by the author is to reestablish Torreya in the same location, which has a specific wetter and cooler microclimate that is beneficial to the growth of Torreya. The professor in the listening, however, argues that it won't be successful because the climate has strongly changed. Two reasons might account for the change. For one thing, global warming led to an increase in overall temperature. For another, wetlands in Florida were drained. All of which contribute to the fact that the condition Torreya used to thrive has become drier and is therefore no longer suitable for them.
The second option is to move Torreya to an entirely different location far from its original area. The professor in the listening, however, argues that it will lead to an unpredictable outcome. She elaborated on an example that people used to move another species, and this kind of plant spread so rapidly that it killed the local species, which were also endangered.
The last approach is to preserve Torreya in research centers which have a closely monitored environment. The professor in the listening rebuts this argument, suggesting that it's not practical since the population in research centers cannot resist diseases. In order to survive diseases, its population needs to be large and genetically diverse, which in the wild Torreya can satisfy this criterion. However, there apparently won't be enough capacity in the research centers to keep a large and diverse population of Torreya trees.
