# Learn by yourself or with a teacher?

People who oppose the idea of students taking part time jobs say that students should use their time to focus  on exclusively on studying. I would argue instead that part-time jobs helps students focus on their studies, provides valuable practical experience, and allows them a feeling of success and independence that is a perfect complement to their academic pursuits.
A popular criticism of schools is that they are "ivory towers," or places where study and research are divorced from the "real world". A part-time job related to their major gives students an exciting chance to apply the theories they have learned in school. Chemistry is a notoriously abstract, boring, difficult subject. When a student
takes a part-time job in a medical research lab, however, he/she might discover how important studying Chemistry
is for saving people's lives. This student might then return to his/her Chemistry studies with renewed vigor. What
was an abstract academic pursuit becomes a concrete and interesting goal with a real relationship to the student's
life.
Part-time jobs also help students strengthen their resumes, build important contacts with companies, and
familiarize them with the contemporary state of their respective fields. No matter how hard they try, Computer
Science textbook publishers cannot keep up with the rapid development of new computer hardware, software, and
programming languages. C.S. students who wish to maintain a competitive edge in the job market should find
part-time positions where they can learn state-of-the-art techniques. After they graduate from college, they might
then return to their part-time employer to look for a full-time position, or approach other employers with good
references and cutting-edge work experience.
Finally, the feeling of success that comes from holding a part-time job can build students' confidence. Knowing
that they can do a job well and be paid for it is an important character-building experience that many students put
off for too long. Learning to manage the money that they make will be a critical part of their future lives. If they
make mistakes handling their money in college, the results will probably not be disastrous, but will teach them
valuable lessons that they will be sure to remember in the future, when they will be truly independent.
