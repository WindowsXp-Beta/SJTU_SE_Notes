# Grade encourage students to learn

> date:2021.8.24

Having a glimpse of the current situation in eduation around globe, you may marvel at the large variety of exams students have to take each semester. And People are having different opinions about whether grades encourage students to learn. I believe it is admitted that marks really arouse student's passion towards learning.

First and foremost, grades provide considerable impetus to students. The intention to become the “Top one” always urges them to study hard and try their best. For example, when a competition starts among classmates, those who win will endeavor to safeguard their superior results, whereas those who lose will also strive to erase past mistakes and continue the fight for a better outcome next time. It is due to such a mental status that students gain the initiative to learn.

Furthermore, grades also help reveal a student’s shortcomings in study which includes two aspects: knowledge not fully understood and problems in study methods. For example, when I was in high school and prepared for the Physics Olympics, we have exams every single day. Whenever the score and ranking were announced, I would go all out to find out the reasons for the loss of marks. After detailed examining and careful analysis, I would notice what has been neglected previously and if there were omissions in my study plan. Thus, I could pay my attention to those drawbacks indicated in the tests. Thanks to all the exams I had token, I got a good grade in the final Olympics.

Admittedly, there is doubt that some students are “high scores, but low abilities” since more and more graduates cannot qualify their jobs. However, this problem can be easily addressed if school takes actions. For example, starting a variety of programs aimed at finding out students' interests as well as broadening their understanding of industry, offering students time to take part-time jobs or internship to increase their working experience and holding lectures about career plan, all these enjoyable activities will bridge the gap between school and working life.

Concerning all the details mentioned above, there is every reason to believe that grades contribute much to encouraging students to learn.
