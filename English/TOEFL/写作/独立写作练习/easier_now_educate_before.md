# It is easier nowadays to get educated than before

> date:2021.8.31

University fees can be quite expensive nowadays, and this may lead to some people think that education is becoming less attainable than before.However,I don't agree with that.(From my perspective, it is actually much easier for most people to get an education in today's society compared to the past.)

First and foremost,  getting education has never been easier thanks to the computerization.One big change is that distance education like coursera and Khan Academy has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes.Whereas in the past, people have to move to big cities or towns to get good education, now even those in rural and remote areas can take online courses and receive quality instructions.Computerization has also brought a variety of smaller advantages:electronic dictionaries enables us to look up words more effieciently; educational programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interact with information in more vivid ways; watching informative videos online can stimulate our interests outside the classroom.

Furthermore, getting education has became far more attainable because it's no longer restricted to upper-class of society. While before only the rich can afford the tuition fee for prestigious institutions, today most schools are affordable for most people to attend. Even if they cannot afford to pay the tuition ,determined students can obtain scholarships and take out students loans with .Moreever, since education has became a higher priority in today's society,private tutors are more common and no longer reserved to high-class families.

Last but not least, government has greater involvement in promoting education.In China, for example, education is compulsory from grade 1 to 9 and government has created programs to send teachers to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimum level of schooling.Thanks to those policies, today more and more students from those areas can enter the college and get advanced education, which consequently changed their whole life.What's more, China has implenmented government-sponsered exchange programs, which offer students opportunities to study abroad.In constrast to before, when government only concerned themselves with educations of elites, nowadays government are very involved in education of ordinary citizens.

Concerning all the details mentioned above, there is every reason to believe that it's easier nowadays to get educated than before.

First and foremost, getting educated(getting an education) has never been easier thanks to computerization. One significant change is that distance education like Coursera and Khan Academy has made it possible for people to access educational resources and earn advanced degrees from the comfort of their homes. Whereas in the past, people have to move to big cities or towns to get a good education, now even those in rural and remote areas can take online courses and receive quality instructions. Computerization has also brought a variety of minor advantages: electronic dictionaries enable us to look up words more efficiently; educational programs and smart-phone apps make it possible for us to interact with information in more vivid ways; watching informative videos online can stimulate our interests outside the classroom.

Furthermore, education has become far more attainable because it's no longer restricted to the upper-class of society. While before only the rich can afford the tuition fee for prestigious institutions, today good schools are affordable enough for most people to attend. Even if they cannot afford to pay the tuition, determined students can obtain scholarships and take out students loans. Moreover, since education has become a higher priority in today's society, private tutors are more common and no longer reserved for high-class families.

Last but not least, governments have greater involvement in promoting education. In China, for example, education is compulsory from grade 1 to 9 and the government has created programs to send teachers to less developed areas in order to ensure that everyone receives this minimum level of schooling. Thanks to those policies, today more and more students from those areas can enter college and get advanced education, which consequently changed their whole life. What's more, China has implemented government-sponsored exchange programs, which offer students opportunities to study abroad. In contrast to before, when governments only concerned themselves with the education of elites, nowadays the government are very involved in education of ordinary citizens.

Concerning all the details mentioned above, there is every reason to believe that it's easier nowadays to get educated than before.
