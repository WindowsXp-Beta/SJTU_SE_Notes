## FAQ

1. X86-64 VS i386
    - i386 is the name of the 32-bit instruction set first implemented by Intel in the 386 processor. It became dominant thanks to dirt-cheap PC hardware.
    - x86-64 (aka. x64, x86_64 and intel 64) is the name of the AMD extension added to i386 to make it capable of executing 64-bit code. This is the one you have. It is highly compatible with i386 and will execute a 32-bit program as fast as an i386 processor.
