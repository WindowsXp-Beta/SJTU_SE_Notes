## How does Google analytics count users?

> [ref](https://www.hotjar.com/google-analytics/glossary/users/)

- If a visitor accesses your site from multiple devices (for example, a laptop first and a smartphone later), GA will count visits from each device as coming from a different user
- If a visitor has multiple browsers on the same device and uses them interchangeably, GA will assign a separate client ID to each 
- If a visitor regularly deletes or blocks cookies, they will be counted as new every time they come back to your site after cookie deletion
- Visitors who use Incognito or Private Browsing Mode on their browsers will always appear as new users, as the browser won’t save cookies and/or site data

## How does Google track user location?

Google Analytics tracks user’s location based on their IP address.  That means users are tracked based on where their internet connection is, not necessarily where they are.

## Does Google Analytics Track Users By IP Addresses?

We hear a lot of questions regarding whether or not the *Google Analytics* program can track users by IP address.The short answer is no.Google forbids the tracking of users by **Personal Identifiable Information** (ie. IP address), and in order to use the Google Analytics system you must agree to it's TOS, which states this condition. The data that you receive within through Analytics is aggregated data. Google does however provide geographical data to give you a more clear understanding of your users and their locations, but it lacks the specificity that the IP address would grant.
