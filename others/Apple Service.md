### 导入自己的歌到apple music

双击一首歌并使用apple music播放后，在Library > Songs里，可以看到这首歌被加入了Library，正处于uploading状态。可见这首歌正在上传。具体有哪些cloud status可见[apple support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203564)和[this post](https://www.imore.com/how-check-if-your-macs-songs-are-uploaded-matched-purchased-or-apple-music-drm-laden)。

1. uploaded

    You use iCloud Music Library (either via Apple Music or the stand-alone iTunes Match service). This status means that Apple has scanned and uploaded this track from your library to its servers; when you re-download it, it'll show up in its original format — 128kbps mp3, 256kbps AAC, however you uploaded it.

    As long as you've downloaded this track to your library before ending your Match or Music subscriptions, it's yours forever.

2. matched

    You use iCloud Music Library (via Apple Music or the stand-alone iTunes Match service). This status means that Apple has scanned and matched the track in your Mac's library with a song in its iTunes Store catalog; when you re-download it on any other device (up to 10) — or delete and re-download the track on your Mac — you'll get that iTunes track, in 256kbps Matched DRM-free AAC (m4a) format.

3. Apple Music

    If you see this status, you've subscribed to Apple Music. This status is assigned to any songs downloaded from Apple's streaming catalog. Apple Music files are stored as 256k AAC (m4p) files and have FairPlay copyright protection on them; if you ever cancel your Apple Music subscription, you'll lose access to these files.

4. No Longer Available

    This status is somewhat rare and applies primarily to Apple Music tracks that were once available via the subscription service, but due to licensing issues or otherwise, Apple Music no longer has the rights to stream them.

如果上传失败，有可能是mp4文件格式不行，要转成mp3再传。

Library中的所有歌都会在多端设备同步。可以通过Get Info查看具体这首歌的状态。
